VivaPortugal AI Content Automation Stack

End-to-end AI workflow for transforming raw product and travel photos into Pinterest-ready visual assets with SEO metadata and board placement logic.

One image → premium visual → traffic-ready Pinterest pin.

This repository demonstrates how AI can automate the full Pinterest content pipeline — from raw visual input to long-term organic discovery.

Why it matters

Pinterest rewards consistent, high-quality vertical content, but producing it manually is slow and hard to scale.

Creators and brands typically face three problems:

⏱️ Time — preparing visuals, crops, and metadata takes minutes per image

📉 SEO uncertainty — weak titles or wrong boards limit reach

🔁 Poor scalability — manual workflows don’t support daily publishing

This project shows how AI can automate the entire Pinterest content workflow, end to end.

What this repository demonstrates

A two-layer AI content automation stack:

AI Product & Lifestyle Visual Generation

Pinterest Pin Creation & SEO Optimization

Together, they form a reusable, production-oriented workflow.

Layer 1 — AI Product & Lifestyle Visual Generation
Purpose

Transform a raw product photo into premium Portuguese-themed lifestyle visuals
without manual preparation, background removal, or design work.

Workflow
1️⃣ Original product image (raw input)

Standard product photo uploaded by the user.
No background removal, no transparent PNG, no preparation required.

📁 Example:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikhail-gonnochenko/Pinterest-Pin-creator/main/product_input.jpg" width="400"/>

2️⃣ Automatic product isolation & scene adaptation

The system automatically:

Detects the primary product

Isolates it from the original background

Prepares it for lifestyle composition

No visible masking.
No Photoshop.
No external mockup tools.

This step replaces:

manual background removal

PNG preparation

traditional mockup workflows

3️⃣ AI-generated Portuguese lifestyle mockups

The isolated product is placed into Portugal-inspired lifestyle scenes:

Soft natural daylight

Realistic shadows

Calm, premium aesthetic

Multiple variations:

location

mood

lighting

interior / outdoor scenes

📁 Example:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikhail-gonnochenko/Pinterest-Pin-creator/main/lifestyle_mockups.jpg" width="400"/>




⬇️ Preview


Result: marketing-ready lifestyle visuals from a single raw image.

Layer 2 — Pinterest Pin Creator & SEO Optimizer
Purpose

reach

saves

long-term discovery

What it does

Crops images to Pinterest-recommended 2:3 ratio (1000×1500)
