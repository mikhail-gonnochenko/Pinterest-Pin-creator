VivaPortugal AI Content Automation Stack

End-to-end AI workflow for transforming raw product and travel photos into Pinterest-ready visual assets with SEO metadata and board-placement logic.

One image → premium visual → traffic-ready Pinterest pin.

This repository demonstrates how AI can automate the full Pinterest content pipeline — from raw visual input to long-term organic discovery.

Why it matters

Pinterest rewards consistent, high-quality vertical content, but producing it manually is slow, repetitive, and hard to scale.

Creators and brands typically face three problems:

⏱️ Time — preparing visuals, crops, and metadata takes minutes per image

📉 SEO uncertainty — weak titles, descriptions, or wrong boards limit reach

🔁 Poor scalability — manual workflows don’t support daily publishing

This project shows how AI can solve all three in a single automated flow, focused on long-term organic reach, not short-term hacks or paid ads.

What this repository demonstrates

A two-layer AI content automation stack:

AI Product & Lifestyle Visual Generation

Pinterest Pin Creator & SEO Optimizer

Together, they form a reusable, production-oriented Pinterest workflow.

Layer 1 — AI Product & Lifestyle Visual Generation
Purpose

Transform a raw product photo into premium Portuguese-themed lifestyle visuals
without manual preparation, background removal, or design work.

Workflow
1️⃣ Original product image (raw input)

Standard product photo uploaded by the user.
No background removal, no transparent PNG, no manual cleanup required.

📷 Example input:

2️⃣ Automatic product isolation & scene adaptation

The system automatically:

identifies the primary product

isolates it from the original background

prepares it for composition

No visible masking. No Photoshop. No external mockup tools.

📷 Automatic isolation result:

3️⃣ AI-generated Portuguese lifestyle mockups

The isolated product is placed into realistic, Portugal-inspired lifestyle scenes:

soft daylight

natural shadows

premium, calm aesthetic

Multiple variations are generated:

location

mood

lighting

interior vs outdoor scenes

This replaces traditional mockup packs and manual design workflows.

📷 Lifestyle mockups:

Layer 2 — Pinterest Pin Creator & SEO Optimizer
Purpose

Convert any visual (travel photo or product mockup) into a Pinterest-ready pin optimized for:

reach

saves

long-term discovery

What it does

Crops images to Pinterest-recommended 2:3 ratio (1000×1500)

Preserves key visual elements:

main subject

landmarks

leading lines

Generates Pinterest-optimized metadata:

SEO title

pin description

hashtags

Recommends the most relevant Pinterest board using fixed decision logic

The output is a ready-to-publish Pinterest asset — no manual editing required.

📷 Final Pinterest pin output:

End-to-End Flow (Product → Pinterest)

Raw product photo
→ automatic product isolation
→ AI lifestyle mockup generation
→ Pinterest 2:3 crop
→ SEO metadata generation
→ board recommendation
→ Pinterest-ready pin

The same Pinterest optimization layer is also used for:

travel photography

lifestyle imagery

brand visuals

Use cases

Pinterest marketing specialists

Travel & lifestyle brands

Etsy & e-commerce sellers

Print-on-demand businesses

Content creators & photographers

Technology overview

Google AI Studio (vision + text models)

Prompt-driven decision logic

Image processing enforcement (format & ratio)

Pinterest SEO & board-selection rules

No-code / low-code architecture

Live context

This AI stack is actively used for:

VivaPortugal brand

Product and travel content automation

The workflows demonstrated here are platform-agnostic and can be adapted to other visual-first channels.

Key distinction

optimizes content specifically for Pinterest discovery

One input → one automated flow → one traffic-ready asset.
