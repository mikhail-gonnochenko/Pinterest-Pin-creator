VivaPortugal AI Content Automation Stack

End-to-end AI workflow for transforming raw product and travel photos
into Pinterest-ready visual assets with SEO and board placement logic.

From a single image → premium visual → Pinterest traffic asset
in one automated, production-oriented flow.

Why it matters

Pinterest rewards consistent, high-quality vertical content, but producing it manually is slow, repetitive, and hard to scale.

Creators and brands typically face three problems:

⏱️ Time — preparing visuals, crops, and metadata takes minutes per image

📉 SEO uncertainty — weak titles, descriptions, or wrong boards limit reach

🔁 Poor scalability — manual workflows don’t support daily publishing

This project demonstrates how AI can be used to automate the full Pinterest content pipeline — from raw image input to a traffic-ready pin.

The focus is on long-term organic reach, not short-term hacks or paid ads.

What this repository demonstrates

This repository documents a two-layer AI workflow:

Visual asset creation (product & lifestyle visuals)

Pinterest optimization & distribution logic

Together, they form a reusable AI content automation stack.

Layer 1 — AI Product & Lifestyle Visual Generation
Purpose

Transform a raw product photo into premium Portuguese-themed lifestyle mockups without manual preparation.

Workflow

1️⃣ Original product image (raw input)

Standard product photo

No pre-cut PNG required

2️⃣ AI background isolation

The system isolates the product from its original background

Produces a clean product asset suitable for composition

3️⃣ AI-generated Portuguese lifestyle mockups

Realistic environments inspired by Portugal

Soft daylight, natural shadows, premium aesthetic

Multiple variations (location, mood, lighting)

This removes the need for:

manual background removal

external mockup preparation

Photoshop-based workflows

Layer 2 — Pinterest Pin Creator & SEO Optimizer
Purpose

Convert any visual (travel photo or product mockup) into a Pinterest-ready pin optimized for reach and saves.

What it does

Crops images to the Pinterest-recommended 2:3 ratio (1000×1500)

Preserves key visual elements (subject, landmarks, leading lines)

Generates Pinterest-optimized metadata:

SEO title

Pin description

Hashtags

Recommends the most relevant Pinterest board using fixed decision logic

The output is a ready-to-publish Pinterest asset — no manual editing required.

End-to-End Flow (Product → Pinterest)
Raw product photo
→ AI background isolation
→ Lifestyle mockup generation
→ Pinterest 2:3 crop
→ SEO metadata
→ Board recommendation
→ Pinterest-ready pin


The same Pinterest optimization layer is also used for:

travel photography

lifestyle imagery

brand visuals

Use cases

Designed for professionals who rely on Pinterest as a long-term traffic channel:

Pinterest marketing specialists

Travel & lifestyle brands

Etsy & e-commerce sellers

Print-on-demand businesses

Content creators & photographers

Especially useful for daily or weekly publishing workflows.

Visual examples (recommended structure)
1️⃣ Original input image

(raw product or travel photo)

2️⃣ Clean product cutout

(result of background isolation)

3️⃣ AI-generated lifestyle mockup

(Portuguese aesthetic)

4️⃣ Pinterest-ready pin

(2:3 crop + SEO metadata + board recommendation)

Technology overview

Google AI Studio (vision + text models)

Prompt-driven decision logic

Image processing enforcement (format & ratio)

Pinterest SEO and board-selection rules

No-code / low-code architecture

This repository focuses on workflow logic and results,
not on training custom ML models.

Live context

This AI stack is actively used for:

VivaPortugal brand

Pinterest organic traffic experiments

Product and travel content automation

The workflows demonstrated here are platform-agnostic
and can be adapted to other visual-first channels.

Key distinction

Unlike standalone mockup tools or caption generators, this system:

accepts raw input images

performs background isolation as part of the workflow

generates marketing-ready visuals

optimizes content specifically for Pinterest discovery

One input → one automated flow → one traffic-ready asset.
